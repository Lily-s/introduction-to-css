          <p><strong>Laser engraving</strong> is a cutting-edge
          manufacturing technique that employs a concentrated beam of laser
          light to etch designs, logos, and text onto various materials,
          including wood, glass, acrylic, metal, and leather. This process
          allows for high precision and intricate detailing, making it ideal for
          applications ranging from personalized gifts to industrial product
          markings. </p>The laser removes material in a controlled manner, creating
          a permanent mark that is resistant to wear and fading. As a versatile
          and efficient method, laser engraving is increasingly favored in both
          small-scale crafts and large-scale manufacturing, providing businesses
          with the ability to customize their products effortlessly.
